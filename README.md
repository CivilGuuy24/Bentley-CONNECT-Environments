The Storing of Bentley CONNECT Edition WorkSpace configuration files (.cfg's) in a GitHub repository allows for version control, collaboration, and easy access to historical changes.


To manage Bentley CONNECT Edition Workspace versions using GitHub, you can follow several practices that have been shared by various users and organizations. Here's an overview based on information gathered from different sources:

### Setting Up and Managing Workspaces

1. **Creating and Managing Workspaces and WorkSets**:
   - In Bentley CONNECT Edition, the concept of Workspaces and WorkSets has evolved from the older "Projects" setup in V8i. Workspaces generally manage company or client standards, while WorkSets are more focused on project-specific configurations.
   - Creating a WorkSet involves starting the software, selecting either the Imperial or Metric Standards Workspace, and then creating a new WorkSet for each project. This can be done through the user interface by selecting the "Create a WorkSet" button and providing the necessary details【[33†source](https://docs.bentley.com/LiveContent/web/OpenRoads%20Designer%20CONNECT-v11/en/GUID-04100951-AF20-4934-B237-88A94EC73688.html)】【32†source】.

2. **Migrating V8i Projects to CONNECT Edition**:
   - Bentley provides tools like the Configuration Migration Utility to assist in converting V8i Projects to CONNECT Edition WorkSets. This process might involve changes to the configuration files and the creation of a `.dgnws` file that holds the WorkSet's properties【32†source】.

3. **Understanding Configuration Levels**:
   - Workspaces and WorkSets in CONNECT Edition are designed to provide a layered configuration approach, where project standards are layered over corporate/client standards, which are themselves layered over base standards. This approach helps in maintaining a consistent configuration across different projects and clients【33†source】.

### Using GitHub for Version Control

1. **Storing Configuration Files**:
   - Store your WorkSpace and WorkSet configuration files (`.cfg` files) in a GitHub repository. This allows for version control, collaboration, and easy access to historical changes.

2. **Managing Updates and Versions**:
   - Use branches to manage different versions of your WorkSpaces. For example, you can create branches for different projects or clients, and merge changes from development branches into a main branch once they are validated.

3. **Automating Workflows**:
   - Implement GitHub Actions to automate tasks such as validation of configuration files, deployment of updates to Bentley CONNECT environments, and running tests to ensure that the configurations work as expected.

### Example Workflow

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - Organize your repository to separate WorkSpaces and WorkSets. For example:
     ```
     /workspaces
         /clientA
             workspace.cfg
         /clientB
             workspace.cfg
     /worksets
         /project1
             workset.cfg
         /project2
             workset.cfg
     ```

2. **Automating Configuration Validation**:
   - Create a GitHub Action that runs a script to validate the syntax and integrity of your `.cfg` files whenever a pull request is opened or changes are pushed. This ensures that any changes adhere to your standards before they are merged.

3. **Documenting Changes**:
   - Use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to document changes, discuss updates, and track progress. This provides a clear history and rationale for changes made to the configurations.

### Resources and Examples

- Bentley's own documentation and community articles provide detailed steps and examples for managing WorkSpaces and WorkSets in CONNECT Edition. Refer to [Bentley Communities](https://bentleysystems.service-now.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=155921c31b2dca50f3fc5287624bcb14) and [Bentley Documentation](https://docs.bentley.com/LiveContent/web/OpenRoads%20Designer%20CONNECT-v11/en/GUID-04100951-AF20-4934-B237-88A94EC73688.html) for comprehensive guides.

By leveraging these practices, you can effectively manage Bentley CONNECT Edition Workspace versions using GitHub, ensuring a streamlined and collaborative workflow.
